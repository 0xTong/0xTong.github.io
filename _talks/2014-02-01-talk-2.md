Tutor Yingjie's explanation in the second tutorial session for the Fall 2023 Academic English Writing course primarily focused on providing feedback and guidance on the second assignment. The key areas covered included:
1. Language Precision

    Refinement of Expression: Encouragement for more precise and accurate language usage was given, emphasizing the need for clear and exact expression.
    Use of 'be': Highlighting areas where the use of the verb 'be' could be more effective, possibly suggesting rephrasing for greater clarity.

2. Logic and Distance from Reality

    Case Studies: Using specific cases, Yingjie discussed the proximity of language to real events.
        Case 1: Illustrating how addressing a problem involves...
        Case 2: Analyzing instances to emphasize or clarify concepts.
        Case 3: Discussing how language reflects proximity to actual occurrences.

3. Argument Development

    Structuring Arguments: Likely advising on how to structure and develop arguments effectively, potentially focusing on the clarity and coherence of the argumentative flow.

The tutorial seemed to incorporate examples and instances from assignments to illustrate points about language precision, logical development, and argument structuring. The tutor aimed to guide students in refining their language, ensuring logical coherence, and enhancing the effectiveness of their arguments within academic writing.
