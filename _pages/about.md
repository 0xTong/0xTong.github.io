Hi there! 👋 I’m Tong Xie, CEO and Founder of [Green Dynamics](https://www.greendynamics.com.au) and Adjunct Lecturer at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au). I co-lead the [UNSW AI4Science](https://unswai4s.notion.site/All-about-MasterAI-UNSW-AI4Science-1f4a59fe367b8131a72ec586362d930f) group with [Bram Hoex](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/bram-hoex). I completed my PhD in Photovoltaics Materials and Computer Science at UNSW Sydney 🇦🇺 in 2025. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Monash University (First Class Honours), where I completed my final-year project with [Jacek Jasieniak](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/jacekjasieniak), and Central South University (China).

🌱 I love meeting new people who are passionate about innovation and impact as much as I am. Whether you’re an academic, an industry partner, a fellow entrepreneur, or just someone with a cool idea, I’m always up for a conversation. I speak the language of both research and business, so I enjoy being a bridge between ideas and action.

🌏 I lead an [autonomous lab](https://www.acap.org.au/post/solar-research-with-ai-and-machine-learning) for perovskite solar cells in Melbourne, equipped with advanced robotics and AI to optimize material synthesis and testing processes. We collaborate globally to push the boundaries of science and innovation.  

💡 I believe in transforming the traditional R&D paradigm, making innovation simpler, faster, and more accessible.
