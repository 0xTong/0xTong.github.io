Dr. Tong Xie is the founder of [GreenDynamics](https://www.greendynamics.com.au/) and a distinguished researcher specializing in the fields of materials science and artificial intelligence.



He earned his PhD at the University of New South Wales, where he leverages large language models for nano-material discovery and synthesis. His research focuses on advancing computational approaches to materials science, particularly in the context of photovoltaic technologies and nanomaterials. 



Tong has published extensively on topics including AI-assisted material discovery, domain-specific large language models, and the application of convolutional neural networks in understanding materials properties. His work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications in the energy and materials sectors. 



Tong has also been recognized with numerous awards, including the NCI TOP10 HPC-AI Talent award from Australiaâ€™s National Computational Infrastructure. He is an active participant in international conferences and workshops, contributing to the global discourse on AI-driven materials research.
