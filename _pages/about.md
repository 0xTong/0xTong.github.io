Hi there! üëã I'm Tong Xie, the CEO and co-founder of [GreenDynamics](www.greendynamics.com.au), and Group Lead of [UNSW AI4Science](https://www.notion.so/greendynamics/All-about-MasterAI-UNSW-AI4Science-3b6ae2e03f104e569289322e5725938c). I received my PhD in Photovoltaics Materials and Computer Science from UNSW Sydney üá¶üá∫ in 2025, where I was advised by [Bram Hoex](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/bram-hoex), [Clara Grazian](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/clara-grazian.html). Before joining UNSW, I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Material Science and Engineering at both Monash University (where I completed my final year project with [Jacek Jasieniak](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/jacekjasieniak)) and Central South University.

**Fun Facts:**

üåè We are building an [autonomous lab](https://anff.org.au/news/using-ai-to-capture-sunlight/) for perovskite solar cells in Melbourne, equipped with advanced robotics and AI integration to optimize material synthesis and testing processes. We collaborate with researchers worldwide to push the boundaries of science and innovation.

üå± I‚Äôm an advocate for sustainable R&D practices and love scaling technology to solve global challenges.

üí° I believe in changing the traditional R&D paradigm, making innovation simpler, faster, and more accessible.[My interview by National Computaional Infrasture Australia](https://nci.org.au/research/research-highlights/ncis-hpc-ai-talent-program-recipient-makes-breakthrough-materials)
