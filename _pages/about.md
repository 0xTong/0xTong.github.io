Hi there! 👋 I'm Tong Xie, a 2024 graduate of the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, where I was advised by [Bram Hoex](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/bram-hoex),[Clara Grazian](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/clara-grazian.html). Now as the CEO and co-founder of GreenDynamics, and passionate about leveraging AI to revolutionize materials science and renewable energy. Before joining UNSW, I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Material Science and Engineering at both Monash University (where I completed my final year project with Jacek Jasieniak) and Central South University.

**My Current Interests:**

AI for Science, LLMs, Self-Driving Labs
Nano Thinfilms and Nano Particles (Inorganic Materials Mainly)

**Fun Facts:**

🌏 We are building an autonomous lab for perovskite solar cells in Melbourne, equipped with advanced robotics and AI integration to optimize material synthesis and testing processes. We collaborate with researchers worldwide to push the boundaries of science and innovation. (https://anff.org.au/news/using-ai-to-capture-sunlight/)

🌱 I’m an advocate for sustainable R&D practices and love scaling technology to solve global challenges.

💡 I believe in changing the traditional R&D paradigm, making innovation simpler, faster, and more accessible.(My interview by National Computaional Infrasture Australia https://nci.org.au/research/research-highlights/ncis-hpc-ai-talent-program-recipient-makes-breakthrough-materials)

Feel free to explore my repositories or connect with me on LinkedIn to discuss AI, materials science, or anything renewable energy. Let’s innovate together! 🚀
