  - **Role**: Co-PI
  - **Funding**: $40,000

- **2023-2024**: UNSW Digital Grid Future Institute Seed Funding
  - **Project**: AI-Powered Datasets Collection and Analysis Platform in Smart Cities and Smart Grids
  - **Role**: Lead PI, Partner Investigator
  - **Funding**: $8,000
  - **Description**: My project aims to address the current gap in collecting and analyzing datasets for smart cities and grids. Creating an open-source tool that compiles data on electricity consumption, PV generation, EVs, and carbon emission-related prices will lead to improved energy management and the promotion of renewable energy integration.

- **2023-2024**: National Computational Infrastructure Australia
  - **Project**: Artificial-Intelligence assisted energy functional material discovery and manufacturing
  - **Role**: Lead PI
  - **Description**: I lead the accelerating energy material discovery plan, including energy data parsing and mining with AI & machine learning methods. Also, we cooperate with many functional materials in energy fields, including battery storage, self-cleaning materials, etc.

- **2021-2023**: Australian Renewable Energy Agency
  - **Project**: Low-Temperature Carrier Selective Contacts for Silicon Solar Cells
  - **Description**: I am focusing on using AI & machine learning to accelerate research of novel carrier selective contact materials. I also help the industrial partner to improve their nano contact manufacturing performance with machine learning methods.

- **2021-2021**: Australian Renewable Energy Agency
  - **Project**: Addressing Solar PV End-of-Life Issues and Lowering Solar PV cost
  - **Description**: I am working with Dr Rong Deng to use natural language processing methods to collect information on the End-of-Life management of solar panels.

- **2019**: Australia Research Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science
  - **Project**: Ion diffusion mechanism in perovskite solar cells
  - **Description**: Under Prof. Jacek Jasieniak, I used a novel technique to collect a large amount of raw data on the diffusion process of chalcogenide. After that, MATLAB was used to simulate the diffusion process during the formation of a chalcogenide solar cell.

- **2017-2018**: State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy
  - **Project**: Study of corrosion phenomena in high-entropy alloy FeCrCoMnNi
  - **Role**: First Leader
  - **Description**: As the first leader of the whole project, I explored the corrosion phenomena of the new generation of high entropy alloys under the guidance of Prof. Lei Qian, which paved the way for the future basic research of the new generation of high entropy alloys.
